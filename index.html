benefits. Be it communicating with friends, searching for information, doing banking transactions,
availing online services, finding job, finding life partner or even running entire businesses. The

                  <p>New and powerful cyber-attacks are striking the internet regularly. A minor lapse in managing our
digital lives can open the door to cyber criminals. Cyber criminals can steal our money or damage
our reputation. According to a study by a leading industry research organization, 90% of all cyber-
attacks are caused by human negligence. Therefore, cyber security awareness is important for
everyone today.
We must be vigilant while making use of technology to reduce the risk of cyber threats.

            <h2>Types Of Cyber Crimes</h2>
            <div class="line-dec"></div>
            <span>A cybercrime is a crime involving computers and networks. This includes a wide range of activities,
from illegally downloading music files to stealing money from online bank accounts. Cyber criminals
are not always financially motivated. Cybercrimes include non-monetary offenses as well. It can
include frauds such as job related frauds, matrimonial frauds; stealing and misusing sensitive
personal information (Aadhaar details, credit/debit card details, bank account credentials, etc.);
defamation of an individual on social media; distribution of computer viruses etc. Cybercrimes can
also lead to physical or sexual abuse.

                <h4>Identity Theft</h4>
                <p>Identity theft is the act of wrongfully obtaining someone’s personal information (that defines one’s
identity) without their permission. The personal information may include their name, phone number,
address, bank account number, Aadhaar number or credit/debit card number etc.<br><br>
Identity theft can have many adverse effects.The fraudster can use stolen personal information and
identity proofs to:<br>
• gain access to your bank accounts<br>
• apply for loans and credit cards or open insurance accounts<br>
• file a tax refund in your name and get your refund<br>
• obtain a driver’s license, passport or immigration papers<br>
• create new utility accounts<br>
• get medical treatment on your health insurance<br>
• assume your identity on social media<br>
• give your name to the police during an arrest etc.<br>

                <h4>Psychological Tricks</h4>
                <p>Psychological tricks are where attackers play with the minds of the user to trap them with lucrative
offers. Once trapped, the attackers can exploit the victim by either stealing money or stealing
sensitive personal information (name, Aadhaar details, bank account details etc.) or harm the victim
in any other way. The entire basis of this kind of attack is to make the victim fall into their trap by
sending fake e-mails, calls or SMSs.<br>
<b>Phishing</b> is the act of sending fraudulent e-mail that appears to be from a legitimate source, for
example, a bank, a recruiter or a credit card company etc. This is done in an attempt to gain
sensitive personal information, bank account details etc. from the victim.<br>
<b>Vishing</b> is similar to phishing. But, instead of e-mail, in this type of crime, the fraudster uses
telephone to obtain sensitive personal and financial information.<br>
<b>Smishing</b> is the SMS equivalent of phishing.

                <h4>Social Media Frauds</h4>
                <p>Social Media has become an integral part of our lives. It is the new way of communicating, sharing
and informing people about the events in our lives. We share our day to day lives on social media in
the form of self and family photographs, updates on our locations/whereabouts, our views/thoughts
on prevalent topics etc. One can understand the entire history of an individual through their social
media profile and can even predict future events based on patterns in the past.Hence, protection and appropriate use of social media profile is very important.<br>
Let us look at some examples of social media frauds.<br>
• Sympathy Fraud<br>
• Romance Fraud<br>
• Cyber Stalking<br>
• Cyber Bullying<br>

                <h4>Mobile Applications Frauds</h4>
                <p>With the increase in the use of smartphones and the consequent rise in the use of mobile
applications, associated security risks have also increased. The number of mobile transactions has
increased four times in the last couple of years, and now, cyber criminals are targeting mobile users
to extract data and money.
Mobile applications are widely used not only for entertainment but also for ease and convenience to
perform day-to-day tasks such as bill payments, bank accounts management, service delivery etc.
As a result, these applications are more prone to cyber-attacks. Users need to be aware of such
attacks on commonly used mobile applications such as digital payment applications and gaming
applications.

                <h4>Online Banking Frauds</h4>
                <p>Nowadays, all banking services are shifting online. Services like retrieving account statement, fundstransfer to other accounts, requesting a cheque book, preparing demand draft etc. can all be doneonline. Most of these services can be done sitting at home.<br> Let us look at some examples of online banking fraud.<br>
✔ Digital Payments Applications related attacks<br>
✔ Digital payments have become very common in today’s life. However, they do pose a threat if the
account is hacked.<br>
✔ Hacking of Bank Account due to Weak Password

                <h4>Virus Attack on Personal Computers/Laptops</h4>
                <p>Personal Computers or laptops play a very important role in our lives. We store our crucial
information such as bank account numbers, business documents etc. in the computer. We also
store personal files like photos, music, movies etc. in the computer. Therefore, protection of all this
data is highly essential. Just as we keep a physical lock on our safe vaults, it is equally important to
protect our valuable data from viruses/malicious applications that can damage it.
Let us look at some examples on how our personal computer can get affected by virus.

          <div class="row">
            <div class="isotope-wrapper">
            <p>1. Always keep your systems/devices (desktop, laptop, mobile) updated with latest patches.<br>
2. Protect systems/devices through security software such as anti-virus with the latest version.<br>
3. Always download software or applications from known trusted sources only. Never use pirated
software on your systems/devices.<br>
4. Ensure all devices/accounts are protected by a strong PIN or passcode. Never share your PIN
or password with anyone.<br>
5. Do not share your net-banking password, One Time Password (OTP), ATM or phone
banking PIN, CVV number etc. with any person even if he/she claims to be an employee or a
representative of the bank and report such instances to your bank.<br>
6. Always change the default admin password on your Wi-Fi router to a strong password known
only to you. In addition, always configure your wireless network to use the latest encryption
(contact your network service provider, in case of any doubt).<br>
7. Be cautions while browsing through a public Wi-Fi and avoid logging in to personal &
professional accounts such as e-mail or banking on these networks.<br>
8. Always use virtual keyboard to access net-banking facility from public computers; and logout
from banking portal/website after completion of online transaction. Also ensure to delete
browsing history from web browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox etc.) after completion
of online banking activity.<br>
9. Do scan all e-mail attachments for viruses before opening them. Avoid downloading e-mail
attachments received in e-mails from unknown or un-trusted sources.<br>
10. Be careful while sharing identity proof documents especially if you cannot verify the authenticity
of the company/person with whom you are sharing information.<br>
11. Note the IMEI code of your cell phone and keep it in a safe place. The operator can blacklist/
block/trace a phone using the IMEI code, in case the cell phone is stolen.<br>
12. Observe your surroundings for skimmers or people observing your PIN before using an ATM.<br>
13. Discuss safe internet practices and netiquettes with your friends and family regularly! Motivate
them to learn more about cybercrimes and safe cyber practices.<br>
14. Do not save your card or bank account details in your e-wallet as it increases the risk of theft
or fraudulent transactions in case of a security breach.<br>
15. If you think you are compromised, inform authorities immediately.<br>
